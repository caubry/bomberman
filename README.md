A simple HTML5 game.

This project makes use of:

  * [Texture Packer](http://www.codeandweb.com/texturepacker);
  * [Tiled Map Editor](http://www.mapeditor.org).

Both are tools to help interpret drawing data in order to reduce load times and the number of HTTP requests. 

Texture Packer is a great off the shelf tool to generate the atlas data; a large image containing a collection of images.
Tiled Map Editor allows the easy creation of map layouts.
They both help retrieving every piece of data easily via a JSON file.

This project also makes use of:

  * Github Pages [Bomberman Github page Link](http://bomberman.carolineaubry.com);
  * Git Hooks for jshint node module with Grunt.
